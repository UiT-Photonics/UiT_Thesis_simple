# UiT_Thesis_simple
PhD thesis template

I made it based on the template provided to me by Mathias Novik Jensen, with some changes. The tikz image is created based on the one from egraff/uit-thesis. This is simpler than the other available UiT Thesis templates and more straightforward to use. Simply put all the files into the same folder and replace the text with your own. It can be used with any LaTeX version.
